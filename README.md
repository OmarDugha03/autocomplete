# AutoComplete Component

## Overview

The AutoComplete component is designed to provide search functionality with highlighting and pagination. It’s built from scratch, and here’s how I approached the task:

### Task Breakdown

I divided the AutoComplete implementation into smaller tasks:

- Search Feature: Allows users to search for items.
- Highlighting: Visually highlights matching results.
- Pagination: Handles large result sets by showing a limited number of results per page.

### Tech Stack

- Next.js with App Router: Leveraged for server-side rendering and routing.
- Typescript: Ensures type safety and better code quality.
- Tailwind CSS: Used utility classes for responsive design.
- shadcn UI: Main UI library for consistent styling.
- Zustand (State Management): Although not used this time, it’s a good choice for future state management.
- Axios with React Query: Handled HTTP requests efficiently.
- jsonplaceholder: Used for testing and development.

### Environment Variables

No sensitive keys to hide.
Used jsonplaceholder API for data.

### Dark Mode

Added dark mode for a better user experience.

#### Project Structure

1. src : the main app where my components , pages , libs and Types
2. components : for all components and components/ui for reusable components
